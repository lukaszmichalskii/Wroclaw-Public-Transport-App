## Wroclaw Public Transport App
The application was created as an equivalent of the vehicle 
location search version made available by 
[MPK Wroc≈Çaw](https://mpk.wroc.pl/strefa-pasazera/zaplanuj-podroz/mapa-pozycji-pojazdow).
The app provides an additional option, users have the ability to check if the desired vehicle
is in the marked area ([the Heaviside formula](https://planetmath.org/heavisideformula) was used for calculations).
### Features
The main function of the application is the same as on the MPK website, see the desired vehicles (their locations) on the map extended with marker clustering
To do it users have to pick desired transport type, line number and set refresh time
(refresh time define time delta between updating vehicles locations) and simply click <em>Run</em> button. Moreover 
map view provides few options known from Google Maps platform like: street view, searching addresses (put text into search box) and many more.

1. Set radius - this will set the length of the segment expressed in meters.
2. Apply settings by clicking  <em>Apply</em> button
